Instead, the benchmarks are written to test the performance of identical algorithms and code patterns implemented in each language. For example, the Fibonacci benchmarks all use the same (inefficient) doubly-recursive algorithm, and the pi summation benchmarks use the same for-loop. The “algorithm” for matrix multiplication is to call the most obvious built-in/standard random-number and matmul routines (or to directly call BLAS if the language does not provide a high-level matmul), except where a matmul/BLAS call is not possible (such as in JavaScript).","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Microbenchmarks","title":"Microbenchmarks","text":"(Image: Benchmark results)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Microbenchmarks","title":"Microbenchmarks","text":"Note that the Julia results depicted above do not include compile time.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Microbenchmarks","title":"Microbenchmarks","text":"These micro-benchmark results were obtained on a single core (serial execution) on Github Actions.","category":"page"}]
